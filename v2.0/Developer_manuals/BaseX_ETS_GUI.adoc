=== Development environment

An BaseX Executable Test Suite is typically developed and tested using the
BaseX GUI application.

==== Installation

For guidance on downloading and installing BaseX see the
http://basex.org/products/download/all-downloads/[BaseX website]. It is
recommended to use the same version that is also used by ETF, currently
version 8.6.

Two additional modules should be installed in the local BaseX
installation as they are frequently used in Executable Test Suites:

* the standard functx module
* the https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-gmlgeox[GmlGeoX
module] for spatial extensions

To add the functx module, select "Options", then "Packages...", then
"Install from URI...", enter the URI
"http://files.basex.org/modules/expath/functx-1.0.xar" and press "OK".

To add the GmlGeoX module,
https://services.interactive-instruments.de//etfdev-af/etf-public-dev/de/interactive_instruments/etf/bsxm/etf-gmlgeox/[download
the latest version of the JAR file] using `etf-public-dev` as user
and password. Select again "Options", then "Packages...", then
"Install..." and navigate to the JAR file. Press "Choose".

==== Executing tests

To execute a test suite against a set of XML documents follow these
steps:

* Load the XML documents into a new database
* Select "Database" > "New..." in the menu.
* Select the XML document or the directory with the XML document or a
ZIP file with the XML documents.
* Use a database name that ends in "-0".
* If necessary, add additional file patterns beside "*.xml".
* In the tab "Parsing" check "Use internal XML parser".
* Leave all other options unchanged and press "OK".
* Open the XQuery document (see link:#the-xquery-document[below] for more information) in the editor.
* Search for the declaration of the following variables and set their
default values:
* Set `$projDir` to the local file path where the project files are
located.
* Set `$dbBaseName` to the name of the database with the "-0" suffix.
* Set `$etsFile`to the file path of the `etf:ExecutableTestSuite`
document.

.XQuery declarations of standard variables
=====================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
declare variable $projDir external := "/home/user/Documents/ETF/ets-repository/generic";
declare variable $dbBaseName external := "errors";
declare variable $etsFile external := $projDir || file:dir-separator() || "ets-template-bsxets.xml";
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=====================================================================

Executing the XQuery should now execute the test suite.

There are additional steps, in case the testproject uses a prepare-chunk document (see link:#the-prepare-chunk-document[below] for more information):

* Set the external variable `$dbName` to the name of your database in BaseX.
* Open and run the prepare-chunk document.

Executing the XQuery document should now execute the test suite.

==== Best practices

During the development of a test suite, it may be handy to compile a
special XQuery that

* loads a test file using the doc() function
* includes the functions that will be called from expressions in
assertions
* sets the relevant variables used in expressions in assertions
* adds the expression of a single assertion that should be tested

This approach may speed up testing during the development. For example,
loading a test document using the doc() function allows to make
immediate changes to a test file without reloading a database.
