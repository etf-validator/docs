== Debugging using IntelliJ

=== Creating a project for the testdrivers

Clone the testdrivers from the following links:

- link:https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-bsxtd.git[etf-bsxtd] ETF test driver for running BaseX XQuery based test projects
- link:https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-tetd.git[etf-tetd] ETF test driver for executing Test Suites on a remote OGC TEAM Engine instance
- link:https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-suitd.git[etf-suitd] ETF test driver for running SoapUI based test projects

Open IntelliJ.

Open the "File" tab.

Select "New".

Open project from existing sources.

Select the testdriver project (select only one of them).

NOTE: In Command line arguments for remote JVM, you have to put the same as in vm options of the webapp


=== Modifying the JDK used

Open the "File" tab.

Select "Project structure".

SDK option will appear as no SDK.

Select the SDK version 11.

NOTE: You can use 1.8 or 11, it depends on the modules you want to debug. In IntelliJ, it is also possible to use different SDKs in different modules, in case you need it. 


== Adding the ETS repository and testdrivers

Download the ETS repository from the link:https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-validator/releases[release].

Extract it.

Run the etf-webapp once.

It will create a folder called ".etf".

Copy the extracted files in the "projects" folder, inside ".etf". 

Put the testdrivers in td/lib/.

Run again the etf-webapp.

You will find all the ETS inside now.

== How to use

Open both projects in different windows.

Run the etf-webapp.

Debug in the testdrivers project.


NOTE: If you want to debug another test driver or anything contained, you just need to add a new module with the contents of the project you want to debug in the project with the testdrivers.
